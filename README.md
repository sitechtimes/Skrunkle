# Description

Skrunkle has been developed with frameworks such as BabylonJS, TypeScript, Vue, and NuxtJS. The game has many different features which includes immersive audio, realistic physics applications, day/night cycles, random generation of structures, and entity pickup and drop. We hope to continue to grow this application with features such as authentication of specific users and saving progress.
